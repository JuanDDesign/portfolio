      <AboutMe>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Juan David Riaño, but most people call me JuanDa. My journey into UX/UI design started while I was
          finishing my degree, and it quickly became my passion. Over the years, I've had the chance to work with
          various companies as a Product Designer, honing my skills and gaining valuable experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my most recent role, I stepped into the position of <strong>Product Owner</strong>, which helped me develop
          strong management skills and a solid understanding of how to monetize digital products. I also learned how to
          evaluate the <strong>success of initiatives through ROI metrics</strong>, ensuring that every effort added
          real value.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my technical skills, especially in <strong
            >FrontEnd development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong
          >. This portfolio is a reflection of my ongoing learning journey and passion for creating impactful digital
          experiences.
