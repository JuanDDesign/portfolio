    ## Analysis

    Transportation companies faced issues with the traceability and documentation of their teams and vehicles.
    This conclusion was drawn after conducting interviews with small transportation companies and one of the largest transportation companies in Colombia.
  
    ## Methodology

    In the first MVP, the solution will focus solely on the documentation of users and vehicles.
    Additionally, fleet managers will need to address incidents and maintenance issues reported by drivers.
