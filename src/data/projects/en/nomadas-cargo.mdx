    ### Problem 
    Small and medium-sized businesses that need to transport heavy loads often struggle to find trucks capable of carrying their cargo.
  </Card>
  
  <Card>
    ### Solution 
    Connect drivers and businesses on a platform where businesses can offer their cargo, and thousands of drivers can view the offers and counter with a price to negotiate a final cost for transporting the cargo.

    ### Results 
    MVP of three apps that connect drivers, businesses, and platform managers.

    ## Analysis

    The current process for businesses to find a driver involves searching for drivers in specific locations within the town and then contacting an intermediary who knows the drivers to negotiate the price.
    The intermediary receives a percentage for connecting the driver with the business.
    We can streamline this process by allowing drivers and businesses to negotiate directly.
  
    ## Methodology

    We created three different apps that connect drivers, businesses, and the management module.
    First, we understood the problem, then we replicated the role of the intermediary between drivers and businesses.

    ## Vehicle creation

    All drivers must have a vehicle registered, allowing businesses to understand the type of vehicle the drivers have and trust the service.
    It is a requirement to have all documentation in order to maintain an active account on the platform.
